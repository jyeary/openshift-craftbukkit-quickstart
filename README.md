openshift-craftbukkit-quickstart
================================

A quickstart Minecraft (Craftbukkit) server that will automatically download latest craftbukkit development build 
and start it.

Create the Openshift DIY Application
===

1. Create a DIY application using this git repo as source code:

   ```bash
   $ rhc app-create craftbukkit diy --from-code=git://github.com/jyeary/openshift-craftbukkit-quickstart.git
   ```

2. Create a port-forward from your local machine to your remote server:


   ```bash
   $ rhc port-forward craftbukkit
   Checking available ports ... done
   Forwarding ports ...

   To connect to a service running on OpenShift, use the Local address

   Service Local                OpenShift
   ------- --------------- ---- ---------
   java    127.0.0.1:25565  =>  *:25565

   Press CTRL-C to terminate port forwarding
   ```
3. The server will be accessible from `minecraft` using **Direct Connect** on 127.0.0.1:25565  


Setting Administrative Player (Op)
---

You will need at least one player to act as the administrator. In order to do that, you must add them to the *ops.txt* file.

1. SSH to the application:

   ```bash 
   $ rhc ssh craftbukkit
   ```
2. Go to the `$OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR` directory:
   
   ```bash
   $ cd $OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR
   ```
3. Add the `minecraft` user names to the *ops.txt* file. I use `nano`, but you can use `vi` if you wish. The updated file should look like as shown:

   ```bash
   $ cat ops.txt
   syeary
   ```
`syeary` is the minecraft user name.
4. Stop and start the gear. I have found restart does not work very well.
   
   ```bash
   $ gear stop
   Stopping gear...
   Stopping DIY cartridge
   $ gear start
   Starting gear...
   Starting DIY cartridge
   + cd /var/lib/openshift/52bc4398e0b8cded36000038/app-root/data/
   + nohup java -jar craftbukkit-dev.jar -h 127.8.212.1 --noconsole
   ```

   Minecraft logs are in $OPENSHIFT_DIY_LOG_DIR/server.log.
